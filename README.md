# Notes Network Archive

This is an archive of the Notes Network I created for my Software Engineering University degree.

## What is the Notes Network?

The Notes Network is a collection of notes documents for modules at the University of Southampton.

The Notes Network is [free to use, study, share, and improve](https://fsfe.org/freesoftware/). That means:

-   Anyone, student or no, can view these notes free of charge.
-   Anyone can download these notes for their own offline use.
-   Anyone can freely distribute these notes to anyone they like.
-   Anyone can add improvements on existing notes, or add new notes documents covering different modules.

Asking and answering questions on the Google Docs comments is strongly encouraged!

What separates the archive and the original is the performance. Google Docs uses a lot of JavaScript to support real-time collaboration, whereas the archive is comprised only of HTML and CSS. However, the archive is not meant to be improved; it is meant to be a 'snapshot' of the network after I finished University.

## Where can I view the Notes Network?

[The original Notes Network is hosted on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OIcQ8dJ_FAhdkirU94M29-ZbNZ4oQs1LbWF3Nz-mq_U/edit?usp=sharing), but [the archive can be viewed through GitHub Pages](https://mb2g17.github.io/NotesNetworkArchive/).
